# CareMa: The Virtual, Shared, Peer-to-Peer Safe Space
Introducing Care-ma, the app designed solely around the benifit of users. We collect no data from you other than posts your make and your user informations such as your name and password (which is encrypted for your security). 

## Our Inspiration 
We realized that many apps that involve positng tend to be flooded with negativity, and other harmful language. We wanted to create a safe space, where people can go when they need encouragement, support, reassurance, or other social needs. On the other end, we also believe that the best way to inspire people is to use the words of others: your peers! So our goal is to crowd-generate positivity in a way that is unlike any other space currently avalable to a broad audience.
